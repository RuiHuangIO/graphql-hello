## My first GraphQL project with Node and React

Being a developer, new technology is always tempting.
While learning front-end frameworks, it becomes apparent to me that I need to learn some back-end stuff to further understand how things work.

This is going to be my first venture into MERN stack and GraphQL.
Should be fun
